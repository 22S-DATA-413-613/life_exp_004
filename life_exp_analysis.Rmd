# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

this is my test for section 004
This is my second update on my branch for 004
here is my third change once and for all for 004

# Analysis
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

```{r}
data("gapminder_unfiltered")
nrow(gapminder_unfiltered)
```
```{r}
gapminder_unfiltered |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) |> 
  ungroup() |> 
select(year, country, lifeExp) ->
  sumdat
```

I want to add some more code.
